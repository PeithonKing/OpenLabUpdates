  - We brought the required equipments from the optics lab.
- **Thursday**
  - Although we got most of the equipments, we still need to get some more equipments like holders and filters, etc.
  - We then designed the 3d models tailored as per our requirements and then printed them.
  - 3d model of Bracket to hold mask: [Part 1](3d_Designs/Bracket.stl), [Part 2](3d_Designs/Holder.stl)
