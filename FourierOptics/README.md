# Updates of the Fourier Optics Open Lab experiment

Here you can find the updates of the Fourier Optics Open Lab experiment.

## Updates

### Week 1

Just read the manual and got acquainted with the idea of the experiment.

### Week 2

- **Tuesday**
  - Read the manual and learned how fourier transform of light works.
  - We made a list of equipments and components we need for the experiment.
- **Wednesday**
  - We brought the required equipments from the optics lab.
  - Although we got most of the equipments, we still need to get some more equipments like holders and filters, etc.
  - We then designed the 3d models tailored as per our requirements and then printed them.
- **Thursday**
  - We completed the models and put them for printing.
  - 3d model of Bracket to hold mask: [STL File 1](3d_Designs/Bracket.stl), [STL File 2](3d_Designs/Holder.stl)
  - 3d model of Bracket to hold filters: [STL File](3d_Designs/Filter%20Holder.stl)

### Week 3

- **Tuesday** (holiday)
- **Wednesday**
  - We got the 3d printed models and then assembled them, then we aligned the laser and the lenses on the optical bench.
  - We played with the existing objects present in the lab and generated their fourier transform images.

- **Thursday**
  - We got some new filters and then we tried to generate the fourier transform of the new filters.
