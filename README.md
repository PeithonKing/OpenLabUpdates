# Updates of the Open Lab (semester 7)

Welcome to our GitHub repository dedicated to tracking the progress of our optical fiber project. Here, we'll be sharing regular updates on our work. Stay tuned to follow our journey in the world of optical fibers.

## Week 1 

- **Tuesday: 08/09/2023**
  - Read the [manual](manual.pdf)
  - Peeled optical fiber coating
  - Washed with acetone
  - Cut it using fiber cleaver and blade
  - Started mounting the laser on optical breadboard
- **Wednesday: 09/09/2023**
  - Read the [manual](manual.pdf)
  - We encountered challenges in preparing and mounting the optical fiber. We addressed issues with screw compatibility, inadequate tools, and height disparities between the laser and fiber mounts. Disassembling the mounts revealed missing screws and worn breadboard holes. Despite efforts to overcome these hurdles, we couldn't complete our tasks due to unforeseen complications, prompting us to conclude our efforts for the day.

  - On the following day, we tackled the height issues by realigning the laser in a different row, and by creatively replacing larger screws with smaller ones in the laser mount to lower its height.
  - While dealing with missing screws in one optical fiber mount, we employed a practical solution by swapping screws between the two mounts. Remarkably, the second mount, although having screws in the same position, functioned effectively without one specific screw, which we then transferred to the first mount.
  - Unforeseen complications led to the end of the optical fiber breaking, necessitating a repeat of the peeling, washing, and cutting process.
  - With a focus on preserving accurate light transmission, we intentionally positioned the input and output ends of the optical fiber in separate rows. This strategic arrangement underscored the critical principle that all light emerging from the fiber's end had traversed the entire length of the optical fiber.
