# Updates of the Open Lab (semester 7)

Welcome to our GitHub repository dedicated to tracking the progress of our optical fiber project. Here, we'll be sharing regular updates on our work. Stay tuned to follow our journey in the world of optical fibers.

## Week 1 

- **Tuesday: 08/09/2023**
  - Read the [manual](manual.pdf)
  - Peeled optical fiber coating
  - Washed with acetone
  - Cut it using fiber cleaver and blade
  - Started mounting the laser on optical breadboard
- **Wednesday: 09/09/2023**
  - Read the [manual](manual.pdf)
  - We encountered challenges in preparing and mounting the optical fiber. We addressed issues with screw compatibility, inadequate tools, and height disparities between the laser and fiber mounts. Disassembling the mounts revealed missing screws and worn breadboard holes. Despite efforts to overcome these hurdles, we couldn't complete our tasks due to unforeseen complications, prompting us to conclude our efforts for the day.
- **Thursday: 10/09/2023**
  - On the following day, we tackled the height issues by realigning the laser in a different row, and by creatively replacing larger screws with smaller ones in the laser mount to lower its height.
  - While dealing with missing screws in one optical fiber mount, we employed a practical solution by swapping screws between the two mounts. Remarkably, the second mount, although having screws in the same position, functioned effectively without one specific screw, which we then transferred to the first mount.
  - Unforeseen complications led to the end of the optical fiber breaking, necessitating a repeat of the peeling, washing, and cutting process.
  - With a focus on preserving accurate light transmission, we intentionally positioned the input and output ends of the optical fiber in separate rows. This strategic arrangement underscored the critical principle that all light emerging from the fiber's end had traversed the entire length of the optical fiber.

## Week 2

- **Tuesday: 15/09/2023** (Holiday for Independence Day)
- **Wednesday: 16/09/2023**:
  - Previously we were using a holding stand for the laser which was not suitable for our experiment. So we decided to use a different stand which was better suitable for our experiment with XYZ axis movement.
  - Then  we checked the amount of light coming out of the fiber using a intensity sensor (photo diode). We measured the intensity of the light coming directly from the laser (400mv) and then we measured the intensity of the light coming out of the fiber (260mv). The intensity values are in millivolts because we were using a multimeter to measure the electricity produced by the photo diode. From the values we can say that we have a good 65% of the incident light coming out of the fiber on the other hand. We thought this is a good enough value accounting for the presence of various absorbing impurities in the lens and the air in the room. Moreover, the lights which are falling above a particular angle not getting transmitted through the fiber. Thus our next job was to find out the maximum angle which the light can make with the fiber axis and still get transmitted through the fiber.

  - In [image 1](#week2-scematics1) we have shown the schematic of the experiment.
  - The light coming out of the end of the fiber was making a cone shape. So we put a screen (with a graph paper attached to it) more or less perpendicular to the axis of the cone. We got a circular spot on the  screen. We measured it's diameter. It came out to be 5.4cm. Next we moved the screen and noted the distance moved (6cm) and took another reading where the circle was bigger (8.4cm). We have attached the picture of the graph paper in [image 2](#week2-graph1).
